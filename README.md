# <img src='icon.png' width='32'> Inkpot GC GTK

## Description
Gynvael Coldwind's inkpot_gc theme for GVim/Sublime ported to GTK+ editors.
This is only a theme, not full config. Based on screenshots from his stream.
Some colors were taken directly from inkpot_gc.vim, others from YouTube
screenshots. Some may be a little vary in comparison to GVim/Sublime original
due the optimization for the Gedit.
