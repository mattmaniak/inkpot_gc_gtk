# Inkpot GC GTK

## Description
Gynvael Coldwind's inkpot_gc theme for GVim/Sublime ported to GTK+ editors. This is only a theme, not full config. Based on screenshots from his stream. Some colors were taken directly from `inkpot_gc.vim`. Some may be a little various in comparison to GVim/Sublime original due the optimization for the Gedit.
